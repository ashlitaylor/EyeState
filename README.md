# Eye State Detection
-------------------------------------------------------
This python code was completed as part of an assignment for my Data and Visual Analytics course at The Georgia Insitute of Technology. 

### Introduction
In this project I evaluated three classifier models to accurately predict when an individual's eyes are open or closed using electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. I performed principal component analysis and recursive feature elimination to test if the models and experiments could be simplified via dimmensionality reduction. I chose the best model based on various classification metrics, and used it to perform temporal analysis on the data to further improve the model accuracy.


The dataset for this project originates from the UCI [EEG Eye State dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Eye+State#), and was collected in 2013 by Roesler et al to understand how EEG measurements could be used to perform classification of a person's eye state. The goal of my project was to evaluate the results of the original experiment and explore some of the proposed future work.

## Prerequisites
This code requires ##Python 3.6** or later and can be run using your preferred Python IDE.
